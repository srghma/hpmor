\leftskip=0pt\rightskip=0pt\parfillskip=0pt plus 1fil{}This book was
formatted by fans of the story, and built on
\today\ from version \gitFirstTagDescribe.
The text was set in
Huerta Tipografica's Alegreya type family.
Chapter headings were set in Lumos, inspired by
the display font used in the US editions of the Harry Potter books,
drawn by Sarah McFalls.
The book was typeset with \LaTeX, and the cover artwork was created with the GIMP.
The source code can be found at \url{https://github.com/rrthomas/hpmor/}.
